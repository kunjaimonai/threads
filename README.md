👟 VeriKicks: AI-Powered Sneaker AuthenticationVeriKicks is a high-end forensic engine designed to verify the authenticity of sneakers using Computer Vision and Machine Learning. By analyzing specific "Trinity" photos (Label, Tag, and Profile) and 3-second "rub test" videos, the platform distinguishes between genuine leather and synthetic PVC replicas with high precision.3. Technical Details 🛠️Tech StackFrontend: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Lucide React (Icons).Backend: FastAPI (Python), Uvicorn (ASGI Server).Database: PostgreSQL (for "Golden DB" reference data).Libraries & AI ModelsYOLOv8: Used for real-time visual object detection and structural geometry extraction of the shoe.OpenCV: Handles image preprocessing, HSV masking for label isolation, and video frame extraction.Pytesseract (OCR): Extracts SKU, size, and manufacturing data from box and insole labels.Pyzbar: Scans UPC/EAN barcodes for digital verification against a global database.CNN-LSTM (Future): Planned for temporal video analysis of material friction (Leather vs. PVC).Implementation BriefThe backend employs a multi-layered forensic approach. It first validates the digital signature via barcode scanning, then performs adaptive thresholding on labels to ensure high-accuracy OCR. Finally, it uses YOLOv8 to confirm structural authenticity, providing a "Genuine" or "Anomaly" verdict based on confidence scores.4.
